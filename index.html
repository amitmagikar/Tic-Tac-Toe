Tic-tac-toe is a fun game that you can play any time and anywhere as long as you have a piece of paper, a pencil, and an opponent. Tic-tac-toe is a zero sum game, which means that if both players are playing their best, that neither player will win. However, if you learn how to play tic-tac-toe and master some simple strategies, then you'll be able to not only play, but to win the majority of the time. 
<br><br>

In a Two player game you play against another person who is using the same computer as you. This means they must be sitting right next to you. Usually this is doen if you are having a party and are bored, or if you have smaller children you wish to teach how to play Tic Tac Toe.
<br><br>

The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. You play on a three by three game board. In our game the first player is known as O and the second is X. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled.

Hope you enjoy the game !!!
